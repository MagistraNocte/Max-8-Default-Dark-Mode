# Max 8 Default Dark Mode
A Dark version of the "default" theme of [Max 8](http://cycling74.com/products/max/). Ease your eyes!

## MAC Installation instructions:

Locate the `Max app` (usually in the application folder).

Right-click on it and select `show package content`.

Navigate to: `Contents/Resources/C74/interfaces/themes`.

Download `default_dark_mode.maxtheme` and put it in the `themes` folder.

Please note: after a Max update or reinstall you have to repeat this procedure.

Now you can select the `default_dark_mode` theme in Max preferences (`interfaces > Color Theme`), it will be applied to the whole program (not just a single patcher) like any other defaul installed themes. Please note: like all other default installed themes, this only affects the current computer Max in installed to.
