# Max 8 Default Dark Mode
A Dark version of the "default" theme of [Max 8](http://cycling74.com/products/max/). Ease your eyes!

## Installation instructions:

Download the `Max 8 Default Dark Mode` folder and put it in the `Packages` folder located in the Max library.

Now you can select the `default_dark_mode` theme in Max preferences (`interfaces > Color Theme`), it will be applied to the whole program (not just a single patcher) like any other defaul installed themes. Please note: like all other default installed themes, this only affects the current computer Max is installed on.
